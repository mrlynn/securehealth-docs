# Welcome to SecureHealth Documentation

SecureHealth is a production-ready, HIPAA-compliant medical records management system that demonstrates advanced data protection using **MongoDB 8.2 Queryable Encryption** with PHP/Symfony. This project serves as both a functional healthcare application and a comprehensive educational resource for developers learning secure data handling practices in healthcare environments.

## What is SecureHealth?

SecureHealth is a comprehensive medical records management system built with **MongoDB 8.2 Queryable Encryption** and **Symfony Security Voters** for HIPAA-compliant healthcare data protection. The system demonstrates real-world implementation of field-level encryption, role-based access control, and comprehensive audit logging required for healthcare compliance.
