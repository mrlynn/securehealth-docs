# Welcome to SecureHealth Documentation

SecureHealth is a HIPAA-compliant medical records management system that demonstrates MongoDB Queryable Encryption technology for protecting Protected Health Information (PHI) in healthcare applications.

## What is SecureHealth?

SecureHealth is a demonstration platform that showcases how to build HIPAA-compliant healthcare applications using MongoDB's Queryable Encryption technology. It serves as both a functional medical records system and an educational resource, emphasizing "Security by Design" principles for healthcare IT professionals, developers, and compliance officers.

## Key Features

### üîí Security by Design
- **AES-256 Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **100% Encrypted Storage**: Ensures maximum data protection
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Built-in compliance measures and audit logging

### üîç Queryable Encryption
- **Search Encrypted Data**: Perform queries without decryption
- **Deterministic Encryption**: For searchable fields
- **Range Queries**: Date and numeric range searches on encrypted data
- **Standard Encryption**: Maximum security for highly sensitive data

### üë• Role-Based Access Control
- **Doctor**: Full access to all patient data
- **Nurse**: Access to medical data only
- **Receptionist**: Access to basic information only
- **Granular Permissions**: Data filtering by role
