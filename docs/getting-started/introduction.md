# Introduction to SecureHealth

SecureHealth is a comprehensive demonstration of how to build HIPAA-compliant healthcare applications using MongoDB Queryable Encryption technology. This platform showcases best practices for protecting Protected Health Information (PHI) while maintaining the functionality needed for modern healthcare workflows.

## What Makes SecureHealth Special?

### Security by Design
SecureHealth was built with security as the foundation, not an afterthought. Every aspect of the system incorporates HIPAA compliance requirements and MongoDB Queryable Encryption best practices.

### Real-World Healthcare Scenarios
Unlike generic encryption examples, SecureHealth addresses actual healthcare use cases:
- Patient record management
- Clinical decision support
- Drug interaction checking
- Appointment scheduling
- Medical knowledge management

### Interactive Learning
The platform includes an interactive demo that allows you to:
- Experience different user roles (Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist)
- See how encrypted data appears in the database
- Understand audit logging in action
- Learn about encryption types and their use cases

## Core Technologies

### MongoDB Queryable Encryption
SecureHealth leverages MongoDB's Queryable Encryption to provide:
- **Deterministic Encryption (D)**: For searchable fields like patient names
- **Range Encryption (R)**: For date and numeric queries
- **Standard Encryption (S)**: For maximum security on sensitive data

### Role-Based Access Control
The system implements a three-tier access control system:
- **Doctor**: Full access to all patient data and medical records
- **Nurse**: Access to medical data and patient care information
- **Receptionist**: Access to basic patient information and scheduling

### HIPAA Compliance Features
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and user authentication
- Data integrity and availability measures
