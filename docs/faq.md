# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Find answers to common questions about SecureHealth, organized by your role and interests. Whether you're a developer, healthcare provider, IT administrator, or decision maker, we've got you covered.

## For Developers

### Technical Implementation

**Q: What version of MongoDB do I need for Queryable Encryption?**
A: SecureHealth requires MongoDB 8.2 Enterprise Edition with Queryable Encryption support. This includes the latest performance improvements and enhanced key management capabilities.

**Q: Can I use MongoDB Community Edition?**
A: No, Queryable Encryption is only available in MongoDB Enterprise Edition. However, you can use MongoDB Atlas (which includes Enterprise features) for development and production.

**Q: What PHP version is required?**
A: SecureHealth requires PHP 8.2 or higher. We recommend PHP 8.3 for the best performance and latest features.

**Q: Is Symfony 7.0 required, or can I use an older version?**
A: While we recommend Symfony 7.0 for the latest features and security updates, the core functionality should work with Symfony 6.4+. However, some advanced features may require Symfony 7.0.

**Q: How do I set up encryption keys for development?**
A: Use the command-line tool: `php bin/console app:generate-encryption-key`. For production, ensure keys are stored securely and rotated regularly.

**Q: Can I integrate SecureHealth with existing healthcare systems?**
A: Yes! SecureHealth provides comprehensive APIs and can integrate with HL7 FHIR, EHR systems, and other healthcare applications. See our [Integration Examples](/docs/tutorials/integration-examples) for details.

### Security & Compliance

**Q: How does the audit logging work?**
A: Every action is logged with user ID, timestamp, IP address, and data accessed. Logs are encrypted and stored separately from patient data for compliance.

**Q: What encryption algorithms are used?**
A: We use AES-256 encryption with three types:
- Deterministic: For searchable fields (names, emails)
- Range: For date/numeric queries
- Standard: For highly sensitive data (SSN, diagnoses)

**Q: How do I ensure HIPAA compliance in my implementation?**
A: Follow our [HIPAA Compliance Guide](/docs/concepts/hipaa-compliance) and implement all required safeguards. The system includes built-in compliance features, but proper configuration is essential.

**Q: Can I customize the role-based access control?**
A: Yes! The system uses Symfony Security Voters, making it easy to add custom roles and permissions. See our [RBAC Guide](/docs/concepts/role-based-access) for implementation details.

### Development & Testing

**Q: How do I run the test suite?**
A: Use `docker-compose exec php bin/phpunit` to run all tests, including HIPAA compliance tests and MongoDB Queryable Encryption tests.

**Q: Can I develop without Docker?**
A: While Docker is recommended for consistency, you can develop locally. Ensure you have MongoDB 8.2 Enterprise and all required PHP extensions installed.

**Q: How do I debug encryption issues?**
A: Use the CLI tool: `php bin/console app:test-encryption` and check the application logs. The system provides detailed error messages for common encryption problems.

**Q: What's the performance impact of Queryable Encryption?**
A: There's a 10-15% performance overhead for encrypted queries, but this is offset by the security benefits. We provide optimization tips in our [Performance Guide](/docs/developer-guides/deployment).

## For Healthcare Providers

### System Usage

**Q: How do I log into the system?**
A: Use your assigned email and password. The system supports role-based access, so you'll only see features appropriate to your role (Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist).

**Q: Can I access patient data from my mobile device?**
A: Yes! The system is mobile-responsive and works on tablets and smartphones. All data remains encrypted and secure on mobile devices.

**Q: How do I generate SOAP notes?**
A: Use the AI Documentation Assistant feature. Enter patient information, chief complaint, and vital signs, and the system will generate a structured SOAP note using AI.

**Q: Can I customize the AI-generated notes?**
A: Yes! AI-generated notes are editable. You can modify any section and the system will track changes for audit purposes.

**Q: How do I search for patients?**
A: You can search by name, patient ID, or email. The system performs encrypted searches, so you can find patients even though their data is encrypted in the database.

### Data Security

**Q: What patient information can I see?**
A: Your access depends on your role:
- **Doctors**: Full access to all patient data including medical history, diagnoses, and SSN
- **Nurses**: Medical data access but no SSN or insurance details
- **Receptionists**: Basic information and insurance details but no medical data

**Q: How do I know if data is secure?**
A: All patient data is encrypted at the field level using MongoDB Queryable Encryption. You can verify this by checking the "X-Ray View" in the demo to see encrypted data.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally access the wrong patient?**
A: The system logs all access attempts. If you access incorrect data, it will be recorded in the audit log. Contact your system administrator immediately.

**Q: Can I export patient data?**
A: Yes, but exports are logged and may require additional permissions depending on your role and the data being exported.

### Workflow Integration

**Q: How does this integrate with our existing EHR?**
A: SecureHealth can integrate with most EHR systems through APIs. Contact your IT administrator for specific integration details.

**Q: Can I schedule appointments through this system?**
A: Yes! The system includes comprehensive appointment scheduling with role-based access controls.

**Q: How do I handle prescription management?**
A: The system tracks prescriptions and medications. Doctors can create prescriptions, nurses can view them, and the system maintains an audit trail.

**Q: What about lab results?**
A: Lab results are encrypted and stored securely. You can view, add, and track lab results with appropriate permissions.

## For IT Administrators

### System Administration

**Q: How do I install and configure SecureHealth?**
A: Follow our [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation). The system includes Docker setup for easy deployment and configuration.

**Q: What are the system requirements?**
A: Minimum requirements:
- PHP 8.2+
- MongoDB 8.2 Enterprise
- 4GB RAM
- 20GB storage
- HTTPS certificate for production

**Q: How do I manage users and roles?**
A: Use the command-line tool: `php bin/console app:create-user` and `php bin/console app:update-user`. You can also manage users through the web interface if you have admin access.

**Q: How do I handle security incidents?**
A: The system provides comprehensive audit trails. Follow your organization's incident response procedures and use the audit logs to investigate.

### Compliance & Auditing

**Q: How do I ensure HIPAA compliance?**
A: Implement all technical, administrative, and physical safeguards. The system provides built-in compliance features, but proper configuration and policies are essential.

**Q: How long should I retain audit logs?**
A: HIPAA requires 6 years of audit log retention. The system can be configured to automatically archive old logs.

**Q: How do I prepare for compliance audits?**
A: Use the audit log export features and ensure all required documentation is available. The system provides comprehensive reporting capabilities.

**Q: What about data breach notification?**
A: The system logs all access attempts and can help identify potential breaches. Follow your organization's breach notification procedures.

## For Decision Makers
