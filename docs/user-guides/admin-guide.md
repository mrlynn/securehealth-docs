# Admin Guide

As a SecureHealth administrator, you have full system access and are responsible for managing users, configuring security settings, monitoring system activity, and ensuring HIPAA compliance.

## Admin Dashboard Overview

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive system management capabilities:

- **System Configuration**: Configure encryption, audit settings, and security policies
- **Audit Logs**: View all system activity and compliance reports
- **Security Monitoring**: Monitor for security incidents and unusual activity
- **Demo Data Management**: Manage demo data for testing and demonstrations
- **Medical Knowledge**: Configure and manage medical knowledge base
- **Encryption Testing**: Test and demonstrate encryption capabilities

## User Management

> **Note**: User management interface is planned for future release. Currently, users are managed through database commands and configuration files.

### Planned User Management Features

**Future Capabilities:**
- **User Creation**: Create new user accounts through admin interface
