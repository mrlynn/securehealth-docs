# ðŸ“¦ Deploying the workshop

## Building/testing it

`npm start` builds a development version of the Docusaurus workshop. To build the production version locally we should use `npm run build` that also checks links. 

It will create a `build` directory. This is a generated static version of the workshop we can host anywhere. This directory is ignored by git.

The Search Box plugin __only works with a production build__. So: run a `npm run build` before pushing your changes to the repo.

## Make your repo public

- to be able to use GH Pages, the repo has to be public
    - if it's private go to repo settings > Danger Zone > Change repository visibility and make it public.

## Add a Secret

- in the `deploy.yml` GH Action file we use the `GH_TOKEN` secret. 
    - we need to create a Github Token with some permissions. Open your [profile settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens > Fine-grained personal access tokens.
        - restrict this token to the repo containing the workshop (Repository Access > Only select repositories)
        - Repository permissions: Actions, Contents, Deployments, Pages and Workflows, all R/W
    - We need now to go to the repo settings > Secrets and variables > Actions and add a new Repository Secret pasting there the token we just created

- The 1st time the GH has failed running as the token wasn't there. Re-run the GH Action so it finshes successfully. It will create a gh-pages branch in the repo, so you know it worked.
- If you changed the `workshopName` in `docusaurus.config.js` everything should work.

## Setting up Github pages

The final step is to configure Github Pages to use the `gh-pages` branch of your Lab. This branch is created by Github the 1st time you deploy the Lab on GH Pages. If you don't see it in Settings > Pages > Branch > Select Branch, go to Actions and re-run the `Deploy to Github Pages` action.

Go to Settings > Pages and select your `main` branch and change the GH Pages visibility to public. We can only do this if our repo is already public.

## Github Actions

In `./github/workflows` there's a Github action to automatically deploy this site in Github pages. You just need to push changes to `main` and everything should happen automagically.
