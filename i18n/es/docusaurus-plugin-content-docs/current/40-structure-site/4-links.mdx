# ðŸ”— Links

You can link to internal or external pages in your markdown.

## Link to MongoDB

When adding links to MongoDB, you should always use UTM parameters to track the source of the link. This helps us understand where our traffic is coming from and how to optimize our content.

Fortunately, this can easily be done with the `Link` component.

### Use the component

In your markdown, you can use this component to create links.

```jsx
Try MongoDB <Link to="http://mongodb.com/try">with a free account</Link>
```

This will create a link that looks like this:
Try MongoDB <Link to="http://mongodb.com/try">with a free account</Link>

## Internal links

Links to other pages of the docusaurus use regular markdown syntax.

```md
[Images](/docs/content-tips/images)
```

This will create a link that looks like this:
[Images](/docs/content-tips/images)

## External links (non-MongoDB)

Links to external website use traditional markdown as well.

```md
[Google](https://google.com)
```

This will create a link that looks like this:
[Google](https://google.com)
