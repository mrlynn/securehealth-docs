# ðŸ“£ Announcements

This is content that will appear at the top of each page as a bar that you can close. Right now is inside `docusaurus.config.js`:

```js
announcementBar: {
  id: "feedback_form",
  content:
    'We are looking to revamp our docs, please fill <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="#">this survey</a>',
  backgroundColor: "#fafbfc",
  textColor: "#091E42",
  isCloseable: true,
},
```

Remove it if you don't want the announcement or change it if needed.
